# 1d-cnn-GMRs
- The three NN models: 1D CNN, 2D CNN, ANN, were used in the paper of "Faster Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment Based on 1D Convolutional Neural Networks". https://doi.org/10.3390/app11219844.
- A small dataset was generated for illustration. Readers are encouraged to try these models on their own data.
- Raw data may be made available upon request from the correspondence author (gchen at mst.edu).
- These models were run in Linux Ubuntu system with python 3.6 and tensorflow 2.2.
